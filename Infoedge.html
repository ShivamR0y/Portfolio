                    a UX designer working on 99acres - India&apos;s largest
                    property listing platform. I identified a problem
                    statement and came up with possible solutions for it.
                    I followed a tweaked double diamond process, with major emphasis on iteration.

                    <b>&quot;Insights&quot;</b> and contained all forms of locality and property based insights, such as <b>historic prices, 
                    changes in prices, etc.</b> To my surprise, this information was presented targeting investors and not regular buyers,
                    difference between which let's be honest, is a very thin line.

                  two international platforms. However, <b>all three Indian platforms had very similar features and use of Insights</b>.

                    Having had a rather dissapointing competitor analysis, I moved on to implementing a UX method well known for it's outcomes -
                    User interviews. I conducted a total of <b>6 in-person interviews, each lasting around 25 minutes</b>, with participants from the office
                    itself. They must have bought a house in last one year to qualify. Next I transcribed, coded and derived Insights from these interviews.

                    Interestingly, the buyer&apos;s journey can be mapped out on a double diamond framework. The journey ususally

                    The journey map was made for the archetype of a first time flat buyer. 
                    This archetype was derived from the people interviewed and the target audience of 99acres.

                    <b>Some other interventions</b>
                    <br>
                    <b>A price Confidence indicator:</b> To curb the problem of people not trusting prices on online 
                    platforms, a price confidence can be introduced on both a single listing and project details page.

                    <br> <br>

                    <b>Insights on the no results page:</b> Data from insights can be used to help a user
                    make smart searches in case of a no results page.

                    <br> <br>

                    <br> <br>

                    <b>Projects that stand out:</b> To reduce the overwhelming nature of the search results page,
                    this widget shows you projects that stand out, thus aiding decision making.

                    <br> <br>

                    <b>Dealer trust:</b> The dealer card was redesigned to introduce review and rating system for 
                    the dealers themselves. Also smaller changes were made to the information layout - like 
                    showing number of years on platform instead of joining date.

                    <br> <br>

                    <b>Trending sectors:</b> Not only does it tell you how is a sector trending - 
                    X new transactions But also why such a trend is there - news updates.

                    <br> <br>

                    With this, ends the major scope of my explorations. Ultimately, I got to explore a 
                    major flow, as well as multiple smaller interventions on the platform.

                    <b>Some other ideas</b>
                    <br>

                    • <b>Landmark based search</b> Travel time from a landmark based search, map based dicovery.
                    <br>

                    • <b>A market based comparison</b> Compare individual properties to the market in its entirety. 
                    <br> 

                    • <b>Introduce social proof</b> Forums, Prop-buddies, reviews and search trends to build social proof.

                    <b>Learnings</b>
                    <br>
                    Working in real world environment, I learned the importance of making decisions faster. 
                    I was often stuck being a perfectionist spending time away for minimal returns. These
                    interventions are not being implemented at this stage. Given the time constraint, 
                    I could not interact with product managers or developers. The project will be further 
                    refined before implementation.
