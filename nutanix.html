                  In the begining of my internship, I enaged in frequent back and forth with key stakeholders of the project
                  to understand the context, stakeholder's perspectives, and build rapport.
              
                  <br><br>
                  Have you ever wondered what kind of data centers does the military use? What about large 
                  established businesses, hospitals, insurance companies?
                  In a statistic published by Cloudzero, over <b>80% of organizations use a 
                  mix of private and public cloud</b>, for business resiliency, efficiency and its cost effectiveness.
                  This mix, called a <b>hybrid multi cloud setup</b>, lets businesses
                   access the best of both worlds.

                  These data lakes implement the<b> Objects Storage System</b>, that works like a valet service.
                  you give to and receive data from the object's manager, without having to worry about where it gets stored iside the lake.

                  Now with the goal of making federations a true hybrid multi cloud feature, I conducted a second round of

                  so the sub admin would requests the PC admin to add it to the Federation. Then, the sub
                  admin creates the bucket and shares it to the end user.

                  Chapter 4: The final showdown

                <p class="body_text">
                  With the approach set, I covered all aspects of the setup using the CRUD framework - Create ✦ Read ✦ Update ✦ Delete.
                  Let us look at one of the major flows, as discussed earlier, of adding a bucket to a federation.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <b>Prism OS's Federation admin page</b>
                  <br>
                  The page shows a summary of the federation, a table of member Object Stores, and an empty table to add external endpoints(storage points).
                  
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/PC Federationempty.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  The PC admin now clicks on add a new External Endpoint
                  
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/addnewmembernuta.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  <b>Add external endpoint</b>
                  <br>
                  Next a form appears to enter the details of the external endpoint, as provided by the Sub admin. 
                  The illustration dynamically updates with the form.
                 
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/Form.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  After hitting save, the new endpoint appears on the federation page. With this, The PC admin role is over.
                  
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/Endpointlist.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  
                  <b>Sub admin Federation view</b>
                  <br>
                   Next, the Sub admin will log onto their view of the Federation, to create a new bucket.
                  
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/Federation_sub_admin.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  The Sub admin now selects the option to add an external bucket.
                  
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/Add_bucket.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  <b>Add external bucket</b>
                  <br>
                  A new form appears, this time for the details of the bucket.
                 
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/Bucket_details.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  A new bucket appears in the list of buckets. This bucket needs to be shared with the End user.
                 
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/Bucket_list.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                 
                  The Sub admin selects the bucket and clicks share. In the new page, they enter the details of the End user to share to. 
                  With this, the Sub admin role is over.
                  
                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/share_bucket.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  <b>End user Federation view</b>
                  <br>
                  Finally, the End user is able to log on to their version of federation and access the bucket shared to them!
                 

                  <br>
                  <img src="NutaImages/End_user_fed.png" style="width: 100%;">
                  <br>

                  With this, ends the first and the most important flow in the entire feature.
                  
                  <br><br>

                  <b>Error States</b>
                  <br>
                  Along with the flows, I also identified and designed the major error states, 
                  and collaborated with the content team to write the error messages.

                  <b>Accessibility</b>
                  <br>
                  Further, I performed a small accessibility audit on the designs, which included identifying screen reader order, 
                  and alt text for buttons.

                  <b>Handoff</b>
                  <br>
                  After over nine weeks of work, I was finally able to handoff the high fidelity designs, 
                  where I highlighted every change made for future reference and ease of understanding.

                    Towards the end of the internship, Nutanix organized an exhibition 
                    of all our intern projects. There, I got the opportunity to explain and exhibit my project 
                    to company wide attendees, including people in the Objects team. Not only was the day 
                    exciting and bustling with energy, I also got valuable insights on the project and vision of Objects storage.

                    &quot;  Shivam was quick to understand the domain quite well even though he had limited time.
                    He had multiple iterations with the product team and  brainstormed on multiple solutions 
                    for federation to cloud from admin and end users perspective. &quot;

                    strategy and was able to deliver a good  experience which well was balanced with technical 
                    limitations we have. &quot;
